# AdvMover

## File Explorer sucks!

### File Explorer lacks a very important feature that could've been very easy to implement.. filtering.

AdvMover allows you to filter which files to move based on given extension, without sacrificing speed (sometimes it's even faster than file explorer!)


## This repository is no longer updated.
### I wanted to move onto more modern frameworks and rebuilt this project with .NET MAUI instead. â†“
